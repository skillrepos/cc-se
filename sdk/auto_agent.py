"""Lab 11 (Part 2): Unattended agent runs that never hang.

For an unattended run, policy has to be enforced on EVERY tool call. The right
tool for that is a PreToolUse hook: the CLI runs it before each tool executes,
no matter what, and the hook allows or denies the call by returning a
permissionDecision.

(ClaudeAgentOptions also has a can_use_tool callback, but the CLI only calls it
for tools that resolve to "ask" -- it is skipped for anything already permitted
by allowed_tools, permission_mode, or your settings. So can_use_tool is NOT a
reliable universal gate for an unattended agent. The PreToolUse hook is.)
